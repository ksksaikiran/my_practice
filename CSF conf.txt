			ConfigServer Firewall, also known as CSF, is a firewall configuration script created to provide better security for your server while giving you an advanced, 
		easy to use interface for managing firewall settings. CSF configures your serverâ€™s firewall to lock down public access to services and only allow certain connections, 
		such as logging in to FTP, checking email, or loading websites.
			With CSF we can block and allow and ip's,ip-ranges, ports,annymous requests from anywhere,
												
		First disable and stop the ufw (in ubuntu), firewalld(in redhat)
		
		systemctl disable ufw
		systemctl stop ufw
		
		cd /usr/src
		
		Download the csf file,
		
		wget http://download.configserver.com/csf.tgz
		Extract the file,
		tar -xzf csf.tgz
		Disable the ufw, 
		ufw disable
		Go to the file where tar file is extracted and enter into it,then cd csf
		sh install.sh
		check the required iptablemodules installed or not 
		perl /usr/local/csf/bin/csftest.pl
		Then edit the file and make changes,
		vi /etc/csf/csf.conf
		 
		 TESTING="0"
		 RESTRICT_SYSLOG = "3"
		
		After editing conf file reload the csf by using command below,
		csf -r
		Restart and verify the status of csf and lfd 
		systemctl start csf
		systemctl status csf
		systemctl start lfd
		systemctl status lfd
		Reload,
		csf -r
		
		/etc/csf/csf.allow    This file allows the ip's and ip-ranges(10.10.0.0/16) that are mentioned in it and restrict the others.
		/etc/csf/csf.deny     This file blocks the ip's and ip ranges that are mentioned in it.So we can restrict any ip and ip-ranges from anywhere.
		/etc/csf/csf.conf     This file is used to enable/disable the testing the ip's and allow/block the ports, also used for web UI configuration and various things.
		
		For WEB UI
		apt-get install libio-socket-ssl-perl libnet-libidn-perl libio-socket-inet6-perl libsocket6-perl libcrypt-ssleay-perl -y
		vi /etc/csf/csf.conf
		make the changes in the file for following details
			RESTRICT_UI = "1"
			UI = "1"
			UI_PORT = "8080"
			UI_IP = ""
			UI_USER = "admin"
			UI_PASS = "admin@123456
			# For security reasons, you should always keep this option low (i.e 0-10)
			UI_RETRY = "5"
			#This option will add the connecting IP address to the file /etc/csf/ui/ui.ban after UI_RETRY login failures.
		
		Edit the file ui.allow file to allow the ipaddress for web UI 
		/etc/csf/ui/ui.allow
		insert the ip that you want to allow
		After editing Restart the services,
		service lfd restart
		service lfd status
		
		Install the zip and unzip file,libwww-perl
		apt install zip unzip -y
		apt install libwww-perl
		csf -r
		echo '!/bin/sh' > /usr/sbin/sendmail
		chmod +x /usr/sbin/sendmail

		
		https://<ip-address>:8080
		
		csf -a <ipaddress> To add to file /etc/csf/csf.allow
		csf -ar <ipaddress> To remove from file /etc/csf/csf.allow
		csf -d <ipaddress> To add the ip into deny file /etc/csf/csf.deny
		csf -dr <ipaddress> To remove the ip from deny file /etc/csf/csf.deny
		csf -x To disable csf
		csf -e To enable csf
		csf -s To start csf
		csf -r To reload csf
